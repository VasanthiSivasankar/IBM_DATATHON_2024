## Problem statement :

Develop an AI-powered emergency response system that can predict patient outcomes in intensive care units (ICUs) by analyzing data from various sources, including vital signs, lab results, and medical devices. 
The system will use machine learning algorithms to identify patterns that may indicate life-threatening injuries or complications, and provide healthcare providers with timely and accurate treatment recommendations.
The goal of the project is to improve patient care, reduce mortality rates, and optimize resource allocation in ICUs, even for patients with no existing medical records in the hospital.

## Solution :

An AI-powered emergency response system, addresses this critical issue by leveraging machine learning algorithms to analyze data from various sources, identify patterns, and predict patient outcomes. 
This innovative solution integrates with existing hospital systems and medical devices, providing healthcare providers with timely and accurate treatment recommendations, enabling them to make informed 
decisions and improve patient care.

## Datasets :

- Electronic Health Records (EHRs)
- Vital Signs Datasets,
- Lab Results Datasets
- Medical Device Datasets
- Emergency Medical Services (EMS)
