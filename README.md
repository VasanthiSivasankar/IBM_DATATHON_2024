## Problem Statement:

ICU healthcare providers face the challenge of making rapid, accurate decisions for critically ill patients, especially when there's an absence of medical records. With the vast amounts of real-time data from vital signs, lab results, and medical devices, manually monitoring patients can lead to delays or missed warning signs of life-threatening complications.

## Example Case:

A 45-year-old male with no prior medical records is admitted to the ICU after a car accident. His vital signs are unstable, and the medical team needs to act fast. An AI-powered system analyzes real-time data, detecting early signs of complications, such as infection or internal injury. It alerts the team and recommends timely interventions, preventing further deterioration and optimizing care. The system helps reduce mortality rates and improves resource allocation, even without existing patient data.

## Solution :

An AI-powered emergency response system, addresses this critical issue by leveraging machine learning algorithms to analyze data from various sources, identify patterns, and predict patient outcomes. 
This innovative solution integrates with existing hospital systems and medical devices, providing healthcare providers with timely and accurate treatment recommendations, enabling them to make informed 
decisions and improve patient care.

## Datasets :

- Electronic Health Records (EHRs)
- Vital Signs Datasets,
- Lab Results Datasets
- Medical Device Datasets
- Emergency Medical Services (EMS)
